Honeycomb Lab â€” gh-pages Source

Place your Vite React project files here (package.json, vite.config.js, src/, public/).
This branch is built by GitHub Actions and deployed to GitHub Pages.

Notes:
- Do not commit build output; the workflow runs `npm ci && npm run build` and publishes `root/dist`.
- Keep `CNAME` at the branch root to preserve the custom domain.
- If you use client-side routing, consider adding a `404.html` SPA fallback.
